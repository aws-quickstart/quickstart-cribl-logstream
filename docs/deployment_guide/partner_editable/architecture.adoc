.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
* An Application Load Balancer to route traffic to Cribl Stream instances.
* In the public subnets, Cribl Stream deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an Auto Scaling group.*
* An S3 bucket to test sending and receiving Cribl Stream data. 
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for a role and policy providing the Cribl Stream instances access to the S3 bucket. You can add other Cribl-supported data sources and destinations by editing the IAM policy after deployment.

* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with Cribl Stream, this Partner Solution deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Partner Solution in a production environment, consider using a private subnet.
